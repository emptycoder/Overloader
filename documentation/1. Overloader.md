# Create own overloader

To start methods overloading on class/struct you just need add:
- `TSpecify` attribute that describe which type was described by default;
- `Overload` attribute that indicates for which type will be overload generated and how name of class will be changed;

Use `partial` keyword on class/struct to call generation of TSpecify overloads.<br>
By default all methods that has overload description will be overload, but you can change whitelist mode to blacklist add `BlackListMode` attribute.

## Example
```csharp
[TSpecify(typeof(double))]
[Overload(typeof(float), "Program", "Program1")]
[BlackListMode]
internal class Program
{
	static void Main(string[] args) { }
}
```
