# Create formatter for overloader
There are only two types of formatters:
- assembly
- class/struct

Assembly target modifier using for creation of global formatters that will be applied to all class/struct instances.<br>
Formatters can easely works with deep substitutions: `Span<Vector3<double>>` will be overloaded to `Span<Vector2<float>>`.

## Signature
Formatter attribute has next signature:
- `Type type`
- `object[] genericParams`
- `object[] @params`
- `params object[] transitions`

The first argument is type for which formatter will be applied.<br>
GenericParams using for generic types to specify templates.<br>
Params parameter maps members to new types.<br>
Transitions helps you to create own decomposition of params.<br>

There are several possibilities to replace parameter types:
- `"T"` - template param will be replaced on type provided by overloader;
- `typeof(double)` - constant type that will be always applied to member/genericParam;
- `new[]
{
    typeof(float), typeof(double),
    typeof(double), typeof(long)
}` - switch parameter that replace key type (i) to value type (i + 1);

## Transitions
To create more overloads for your methods create transition that zip some members to another type.
In example bellow you can see decompose of `Vector3<double>` on `Vector2<double>` and `double`.
Decomposition of method params will be process by next scheme:
```
0 0 0 0 0
^

1 0 0 0 0
^
Repeat until it < maxLength[index]
And when first value equals maxLength[index] reset to zero and add 1 to next rank
0 1 0 0 0
^
				
1 1 0 0 0
^
And so on...
```

So, all substitution variations will be written.

## Example
```csharp
[assembly: Formatter(typeof(Vector3<>),
	new object[] {"T"},
	new object[]
	{
		"X", "T",
		"Y", "T",
		"Z", "T"
	},
	new object[]
	{
		typeof(Vector2<>),
		new object[]
		{
			"X", "X",
			"Y", "Y"
		}
	})]
```
